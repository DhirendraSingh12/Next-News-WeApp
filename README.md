This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Step 1: Download and Install the Node Js from ( https://nextjs.org )
Step 2: Open the terminal and check Node Js is installed or not for this execute the command:
  To check Node Js :
   command: node -v -- It will show the version of the Node Js installed ( For me it 18.18.2 )
  To check Node Packager Manager:
  command: npm -v -- It will show the npm version.

Step 3: Create the project 
  command: npx create-next-app -next-project-name -- It will create the project

Step 4: To open the created project in VS code execute the below command in the terminal:
    command:  code . -- It will open the project in VS code

Step 5: To run the project use below command in the terminal:
    command: npm run dev -- It will run the project by providing URL
     (i.e.  -http://localhost:3000  with your browser to see the result ) usually React js , next js all this project run in 3000 port.

 Step 6: Once the project is open in VS code  we can start working on it by updating the NPM ( Node Packeage Manager ).
  For this open the VS code terminal an execute the below command:
    command: npm update -- while executing the command make sure in the terminal it is pointing the same  project for which we are updating the NPM.

  And If you ae directly extarcting from Github at that time we need to execute the below command:
    Command: npm install node -- It will install the necessary dependencies required for the project.
